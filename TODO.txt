next work group (verify results):
- touch up and verify that the simulation finishes with the same results

backlog:
- linux support
- packet queue so no udp overflow drop
- test with more than 2 machines
- send over sim data to clients for verification step
- stop, pause, abort simulation buttons
- ipv6 support
- clean up network resources on close
- use the input port not hard coded 50051

questions:
- is it faster to udp broadcast a bunch of info or just send required info to the proper guys
