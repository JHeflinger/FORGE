next work group (simulation setup):
- on start simulation set up all workers in a circular fashion, giving the contact info of the "next" neighbor
- also distribute and send the particle ranges over

next work group (oct-tree prep):
- start the simulation loop
- implement oct tree prep

next work group (tree distribution):
- implement tree distribution

next work group (tree construction):
- implement tree construction

next work group (force calculation):
- implement force calculation

next work group (verify results):
- touch up and verify that the simulation finishes with the same results

backlog:
- send over sim data to clients for verification step
- stop, pause, abort simulation buttons
- ipv6 support
- clean up network resources on close
- use the input port not hard coded 50051

questions:
- is it faster to udp broadcast a bunch of info or just send required info to the proper guys
