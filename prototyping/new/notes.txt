Distributed method
    - Initial setup
        1. Split particles across workers
    - Simulation step
        1. Each worker calculate worker-specific field 
        2. everyone share their fields 
        3. everyone apply the fields and move the particles

Test suite measurements:
- accuracy against singlton matrix appraoch
- energy analysis
- timing analysis
  - the big o analysis 
  - how does it scale up (does it scale linearly with sim length? what about particles?)
  - how does it scale up across workers?
  - efficinecy analysis


Naive approach:
    - each worker will calculate the impact of the other particles on the particles it is in charge of 
        ^ this approach does redundant info, maybe we can distribute by edges in the connected graph for the force grid calculation, and then distribute by particles for the position update?
